# Power-Query-Features-And-Functions

Using Power Query for the first time!

Microsoft Power Tools for Data Analyis (MSPTDA)

004.01.MSPTDA: I used power query function Excel.Workbook() to pull multiple excel sheets into powerquery

005.01.MSPTDA: Excel.CurrentWorkbook()function was used to combine and append multiple excel tables in a workbook into to one Data Set.

006.01.MSPTDA: Using the Merge feature, related tables from two different files (excel and text) were merged into a single table. Amended columns of tables in three different worksheets and then used the Append feature to combine into a single Data Set.

007.01.MSPTDA: Here, I learned how to use differen type of joins/merges including InnerJoin(AND logical test), FullOuter (OR logical Test) and Left and Right Anti and Outer.

008.01.MSPTDA: Using the Tabbl.Group function, I prepared a report that categorised multiple customers with specific Managers. Calculated Total Sales, Min, Max and Standard Deviation, then ranked Managers by sales performance.
